# hello-world
this repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow
I have dedicated time to learn cloud engineering, with certifications in Azure and AWS. I have good experiences using docker, terraform, kubernetes, and working with services and tools on AWS and Azure. I am comfortable creating and managing infrastructure, developing and constantly finetuning CI/CD practices and deployment requirements. 
I am playing around a bit more with different side projects which is not limited to Software Configuration Managment Tools (SCM/ Version control).
My passion for learning is one of my greatest strengths. My greatest wweakness or challenge is my inability to give. This usually makes me spend more time than i should trying to solve a challenge. If i have learnt from this, it is the art of priotising based on needs and the most expedient demands of businesses and requirements.
