# hello-world
this repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow
I have dedicated time to learn cloud engineering, with certifications in Azure and AWS. I have good experiences using docker, terraform, kubernetes, and working with services and tools on AWS and Azure. I am comfortable creating and managing infrastructure, developing and constantly finetuning CI/CD practices and deployment requirements. 
I am playing around a bit more with different side projects which is not limited to Software Configuration Managment Tools (SCM/ Version control).
My passion for learning is one of my greatest strengths. My greatest wweakness or challenge is my inability to give. This usually makes me spend more time than i should trying to solve a challenge. If i have learnt from this, it is the art of priotising based on needs and the most expedient demands of businesses and requirements.
I had to do troubleshooting to resolve bash and zsh headache for my vscode. Had to configure the json file in the setting and install brew, sed and nano. Thanks to Tobi for the assist.
